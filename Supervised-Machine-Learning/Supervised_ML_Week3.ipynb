As applying MSE for the logistic regression will give zig-zag convex curve with multiple local minima resulting in the modal getting at any of those minima and doesn't converge to get the optimal values for the modal parameters.

    "# Overfitting, underfitting and generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrespective of the type of algorithm, regression or classification, the ultimate aim of developing and training an ML algorithm is to make the modal predict correctly for unknown input features with atmost accuracy.\n",
    "Unfortunately, when training an algorithm, there can be situations where the modal underit, overfit or in contrast can generalize weill with unknown data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalization\n",
    "Given a learning algorithm, the modal is trained on the training dataset and it performs very well for a given modal parameters. When we test the same modal with data which are not present in the training dataset, the modal shows predicts the output correctly with utmost accuracy. There can be a small number incorrect predictions but on an overall perspective, the modal generalizes very well to the unknown dataset. This is called as **generalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underitting\n",
    "Given a learning algorithm, the modal doesn't even perform well on the training set is called as **underfitting**. This can also be termed as **high bias**, because the modal has a preconception that the dataset has a particular relationship which is actually in contrast to the actual relationship leading to fit the dataset poorly even during the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overfitting\n",
    "Given a learning algorithm, the modal performs well on the training dataset but predicts very poorly for testing dataset/unknown data which is called as **overitting**. This is because, for a chosen modal parameter value the modal tries hard enough to predict the exact output as the actual ne giving a cost of zero. And so this will lead to finding the best-fit which is kind of zig-zag and so when the modal encounters an unknown data, the prediction will be incorrect with respect to the zig-zag best-fit line. This scenario is also termed as **high variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing overfitting\n",
    "In order to address the issue of overfitting, consider the following options,\n",
    "1.  **Collect more training data** - As number of training examples increases, the chances of verfitting reduces\n",
    "2.  **Feature selection** - Select the features which are relevent enough for the problem\n",
    "3.  **Regularization** - Reduc the values of the modal's parameters which are irrelevent instead of removing those features. This will make the irrelevent features have least impact on the modal's prediction."
